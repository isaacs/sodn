# sodn

Sodn is a Self-Organizing Dnode Network, made of
SOcial DNodes.

I'm not sure yet what it can be used for, but it seemed like a neat
idea.

The goal is to eventually automatically discover and bridge arbitrary
network topologies, and pass messages between disparate nodes in the
society, while not flooding the network with messages or creating an
unnecessary number of connections.

To play around with it right now, check out what's in the test/ folder.
To run them, check out the code, and then do `npm install` followed by
`npm test`.

I aim for 100% test coverage with this library.  Previous forays into
the world of botnets have shown that this is one area where anything
less is simply too hazardous.
