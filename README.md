# sodn

Sodn is a Self-Organizing Dnode Network.  It's also a way to build
SOcial DNodes.

I'm not sure yet what it can be used for, but it seemed like a neat
idea.  The goal is to automatically discover and bridge arbitrary
network topologies, and pass messages between disparate nodes in the
society, while not flooding the network with messages or creating an
unreasonable number of connections.
